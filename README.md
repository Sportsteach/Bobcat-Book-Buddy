Bobcat book Buddy - https://bobcatbookbuddy.herokuapp.com/

Provide my school/library/students with a website that would provide better functionality than the current website. 
The site directs students to their next book based on books they have read, genre or author they enjoy. It provides the student with summaries and recommendations based on the books they search. Additionally, it will inform students if the book is present at our library. If the book is not at our library the student will have two choices. They can search the title they are interested in at the local library and they can suggest the book for the school to purchase in the future. If the book was already added to the suggestion database then students can upvote the book with a thumbs up. The focus of the site is to increase reading at the school and aid in library future purchases.

Students will start by watching the video oh the head page
